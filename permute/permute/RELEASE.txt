How to make a new release of ``permute``
========================================

- Check ``TODO.txt`` for any outstanding tasks.

- Update release notes.

  1. Review and cleanup ``doc/release/release_dev.txt``

     - To show a list of merges and contributors, run
       ``doc/release/contribs.py <tag of prev release>``.

  2. Rename to ``doc/release/release_X.txt``

  3. Copy ``doc/release/release_template.txt`` to
     ``doc/release/release_dev.txt`` for the next release.

- Update the version number in ``setup.py`` and commit

- Update the docs:

  - Update ``version`` and ``release`` in ``doc/source/conf.py`` and commit
  - Build a clean version of the docs.  Run ``python setup.py install`` in the
    root dir, then ``make clean; make html; make pdflatex`` in the docs.
  - Push upstream: ``make github``.

- Add the version number as a tag in git::

   git tag -s v0.X.0

  (If you do not have a gpg key, use -m instead; it is important for
  Debian packaging that the tags are annotated)

- Push the new meta-data to github::

   git push --tags upstream master

- Publish on PyPi::

   python setup.py sdist
   python setup.py bdist_wheel
   twine upload dist/*

- Increase the version number

  - In ``setup.py``, set to ``0.Xdev``.

- Update the development docs for the new version ``0.Xdev`` just like above

- Post release notes on mailing lists, blog, G+, etc.
