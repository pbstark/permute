   ``permute`` provides permutation tests and confidence sets for a variety of
   nonparametric testing and estimation problems and for a variety of
   randomization designs.
   
   Benefits of Permutation Tests
   -----------------------------
   
   -  Gives a test with correct type 1 error rate, without needing
      uncheckable assumptions
   -  We can get confidence intervals for the p-value---this tells us how
      many iterations we need to achieve a certain precision
   -  Choice of test statistic is flexible---choose one that makes sense
      for your data, gives high power
