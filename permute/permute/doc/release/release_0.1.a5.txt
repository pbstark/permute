Announcement: permute 0.1.a5
===========================

We're happy to announce the release of permute v0.1.a5!

permute is permutation testing and confidence set toolbox for Python.

For more information, examples, and documentation, please visit our website:

New Features
------------

k-sample tests and the minP familywise error rate correction


Improvements
------------

Every permutation test has a `plus1` option to add 1 to the numerator and denominator of the p-value.

The default PRNG is the SHA256-based CS-PRNG from `cryptorandom`, which should produce higher quality pseudo-random numbers.


API Changes
-----------
`hypergeom` and `binomial_p` no longer use permutations to calculate p-values.

The `seed` argument to functions is now used to seed a SHA256 PRNG instance, rather than np.random.

Deprecations
------------
